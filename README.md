# SB-Poke-Catch-Game-YT
Poke Catch Game using Streamer.bot for YouTube


## **Description** 
[wrap="info"]  
This is a points system for YouTube. Viewers will be able to accumulate points by chatting regularly and then redeem their points to trigger actions you create in Streamer.Bot. **Updated for version 0.2.0**    
[/wrap]

[wrap="warning"]
Be aware that there is not a way to give points to lurkers as we don't have access to that through YouTube. Also, viewers will not get extra points for spamming chat.
[/wrap]

## **Resources** 

### OBS
Make sure your OBS has these two plugins. If you donâ€™t, I have provided links to them.

[Source Copy Plugin](https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/source-copy.1261/)

[Move Transition Plugin](https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/move-transition.913/)

### Downloading Files

Download the Pokemon cries and Sugimori art from [veekun](https://veekun.com/dex/downloads) under "Other files"

[PICTURE GOES HERE]

Create a folder and unzip the folders you downloaded into the new folder. Take note of where those folders are.

In the `Sugimori art folder` make changes to the following images:
- `201.png` > delete the file (it's broken)
- `201-f.png` > change to `201.png`
- `386.png` > delete the file (it's broken)
- `386-[style of your choice]` > change the style you want to appear to `386.png`

Download this ZIP, unzip it, and put the folders in your folder you created as well:
- Catch Chance

## **Configuration** 


### C# Compiler
Make sure to add System.Core.dll to the C# compiler within Settings > C# Compiler > Common References > Right-Click > Add reference from file...

![image](upload://aY0obJyjPCwRxClvKCoIMy5hFtU.png)
![image](upload://ilUpTmBqdbXnjl1XzhfHyIhTY8l.png)

This will help make sure all the C# code found in the sub-actions compiles.

### Present Viewers
![image](upload://g2mFzxYLCVtem0Zm20fWf4qiIm0.png)


This will give viewers points every MINUTE. The slider is meant to select how many minutes of inactivity to no longer consider a chatter as "active". For example, 5 minutes means that if the Present Viewers event runs and the chatter hasn't been active for 5 mins 12 secs, then the chatter will no longer be receiving points every minute.

To adjust the points given every minute change the `%pointsPerMinute%` argument in the "Action - Present Viewers Trigger" action to the number value you want.

[wrap="warning"]
PLEASE NOTE! - Due to the fact that YouTube does not require unique usernames, there is a small chance that two viewers with the same username are in your viewer records. If this happens the bot should send a message that there are duplicate usernames. They will have to change their username or get their points added another way.
[/wrap]

[wrap="warning"]
Also, if you are trying to add/set points for a brand new user, you may have to click "Save" in Streamer.Bot if it says they don't exist yet.
